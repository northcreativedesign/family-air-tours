        <p>Come bend a fly or spin rod in the wilds of Southeast Alaska. We have beautiful small streams and gorgeous lakes with lots of trout, salmon, and steelhead and very few other fishermen. It is not uncommon to go fishing here and not see another group on the same body of water. We provide flies or lures, equipment, and transportation. You don’t know how to fly fish but have always wanted to learn? We can provide a guide who will give one-on-one instruction in the beautiful Alaskan wilderness. Our plane carries up to four passengers and the total time for this tour is about 5 hours with 4 hours of it fishing.</p>

        <p>Alaska is home to some of the best fly fishing spots in the world, and it’s no coincidence that we happen to have some of the best guides around. We’ll pick you up from your cruise ship dock and transport you to our shop, where you’ll be outfitted before taking a 15 minute drive with your designated guide to a local fishing hotspot. You’ll be fishing for primarily rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and dolly varden. Remove yourself from the big groups of cruise ship goers and participate in the scenic, secluded, Alaskan tradition. Check out <a href="http://www.hookupflyshop.com" target="_blank" class="equipment-rentals">Hookup Fly Shop</a> for more details</p>

        <p>Round trip transportation to and from the cruise ship, all necessary fishing equipment (except for your 1-day fishing license, which you can purchase online or at our shop on the day of your tour), and guidance from an experienced fly fisherman.</p>
