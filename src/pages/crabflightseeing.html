        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>The Exclusive Flightseeing and Crab Feast tour is an amazing once in a lifetime experience. You will get to enjoy a fully narrated tour by flight via an authentic Alaskan Bush floatplane to George Inlet Lodge.</p>

        <p>Once the floatplane gently touches down on the waters of George Inlet Fjord, it will glide to a stop at the dock of the lodge, where your host will be awaiting. </p>

        <p>Your meal will begin with a glass of Alaskan Amber beer or wine (white or red), served by the fireplace. Your meal features fresh romaine salad, topped with mandarin oranges and tossed in homemade oriental dressing. Steaming hot Dungeness Crab paired with clarified butter and baby red potatoes follow as the main course. Savor this Alaskan delicacy that is prized for its sweet and tender meat but save room for dessert. Rich, smooth cheesecake, smothered in Alaskan blueberries will be a perfect ending to this world class meal! Youâ€™ll then have the opportunity to relax by the fireplace, observe the breathtaking scenery from the dock, or pick up some souvenirs in our quaint shop before enjoying a fully narrated drive back to historic downtown Ketchikan. </p>

        <p>This adventure is truly an Alaskan experience not to be missed!</p>
