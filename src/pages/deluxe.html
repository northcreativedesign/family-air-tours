        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>What can we say about the Misty Fjords? Between 2.3 Million Acres… it’s never the same. It’s beautiful in full bright sunlight and when it’s really misty and at all the stages in between. Waterfalls, shear granite cliffs, trees growing everywhere, even out of shear rock. A wonderland formed through the millennium out of fire (volcanoes) and ice (glaciers), where you will see wondrous scenery and have a chance to see eagles, bear, deer, mountain goats, seals or maybe even whales. <span><strong>That’s why this is our most popular tour.</strong></span></p>

        <p>This flight starts in Ketchikan and flies through the Tongass National Forest to The Misty Fjords National Monument. This tour lasts for 2 hours (our dock to dock, not cruise ship pickup to cruise ship dock, like many other’s tours) and includes flightseeing through the Monument and a shore stop for 30 minutes on a wilderness Fjord. Your pilot, Dave will talk throughout the flight and <span class="makeup">make up</span> answer any questions you may have.</p>
